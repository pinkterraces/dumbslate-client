# Dumbslate

## Summary

This app allows users to browse obsure movies from the 1980s to find a short description and information about the genre and director, as well as create / edit a profile, and save a list of their favourite films to their profile. 

The REST API was developed using Express framework for Node.js, which interfaces with a MongoDB database, leveraging Mongoose models to query the data. React and React Bootstrap is used for the front-end development.

The app is deployed and hosted on Netlify.
